## Course project (PrF)

### Task

The main task of the course project is to develop a program for airport data management using three types of data structures. 
Passenger data must be stored in a hash table(with quadratic probing). Ticket data should be in a single linked list. 
Information about flights should be stored in AVL tree. List sorting is done by Insertion sort. 
The program must be able to search for flights by parts of their destination names with Boyer-Moore algorithm.
Other capabilities of the program are basic(deleting, appending, search by number).
